# A Beautiful Question: Finding Nature's Deep Design
By Frank Wilczek
![A Beautiful Question](/images/beautiful_question.jpg)

I enjoyed reading this book because it proposes both a unique perspective on the world while telling an engaging story of the history of physics. His scientific approach to this philosophical question "does the world embody beautiful ideas?" serves a strong foundation for his meditation and, for me, produced a compelling argument for the beauty of the universe.
